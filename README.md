### Features

- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so your list remains intact even if you close and reopen the application.

- **Intuitive UI:** Each task in the list includes a checkbox to mark it as complete and a delete button to remove it.

- **Real-time Task Counter:** The application provides a counter that dynamically updates to show the number of completed tasks versus the total number of tasks.

- **Duplicate Prevention:** The app checks for duplicate tasks to prevent you from adding the same task twice, ensuring your list stays clean and organized.

- **Modular Code:** All application logic is contained within a single JavaScript file, organized into distinct functions for improved readability and maintenance.
